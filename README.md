This is my humble [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom component bundle.
These are components that I use in my personal setup. Feel free to use them if you want! But you
can expect breaking changes ðŸ˜‡

## What is this?

These are components that I find useful after running [Home
Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for a couple of years. Most of these were implemented
using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) originally, but maintaining those flows, on multiple
instances started to become a pain. Rewriting them as custom components allows me to write
tests, keep things compatible with the latest HA versions and keep multiple HA instances up to
date.

## Changelog

When updating, be sure to look at the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md)!

  lint-mypy     Lint with mypy
  d-up          Docker compose reboot and tail logs
  d-stop        Docker compose stop

```
